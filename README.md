### ELA

ELA is non-generative AI-driven learning assessment software.

ELA comprises the following components (with their github repositories linked)
* [ELA AI](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/elaai), the AI engine
* [ELA Collect](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ela_collect), an Android mobile application for teachers to capture learner outputs in the classroom
* [ELA Web](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ela), a browser-based web application for teachers to manage the entire assessment process

A companion component is the [ECUBE data collector](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ecube-data-collection), a custom data collection tool that captures learner outputs from the ECUBE English Language Lab (ELL) software developed by KITE.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Driven**  : Designed by teachers and technologists together, ELA is driven by pedagogy, not technology.
- **Teacher First**    : ELA is teacher-facing software. There is no student <-> computer interaction.
- **Offline First**    : ELA is carefully architected to run on a desktop computer. No internet required.
- **Openness**         : ELA is licensed to be free and open source (FOSS). Always.

### What 'ELA' stands for
- 'ELA' is a polysemous acronym (an acronym with multiple, related meanings).
- Language learning assessment is central to the software, and the English language in particular. ELA is English Language Assessment.
- In the immediate roadmap is support for other languages. Here, ELA is E Language Assessment, the 'E' stands for 'Electronic' of course. 
- A future iteration of the software will also support other forms of assessments based on non-speech inputs such as MCQs that the teacher will record based on learner responses in any subject of learning, OCR scans of student paper MCQ responses etc. Here, ELA is E Learning Assessment. Note the absence of a hyphen between the 'E' and 'Learning'. There is no 'E-Learning'. Learning happens in the classroom. 
- Lastly, in homage to the Free Software Movement, ELA of course also expands to **ELA Learning Assessment**

### Software features
- Assessment of English language learner's speech, with focus on early speakers. 
- Support for _monologic_ and _dialogic_ oral productions (the dialog is between the learner and the teacher)
- A 9-point scale based reporting that is sensitive to early speakers' abilities in their home language(s)
- Recommendations of audio stories for learners to listen to, to improve listening skills, vocabulary and overall proficiency in the language (Work in progress)
