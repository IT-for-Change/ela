### ELA

ELA is non-generative AI-driven learning assessment software.

ELA comprises the following components (with their github repositories linked)
* [ELA AI](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/elaai), the AI engine
* [ELA Collect](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ela_collect), an Android mobile application for teachers to capture learner outputs in the classroom
* [ELA Web](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ela), a browser-based web application for teachers to manage the entire assessment process

A companion component is the [ECUBE data collector](https://github.com/IT-for-Change/ecube-data-collection), a custom data collection tool that captures learner outputs from the ECUBE English Language Lab (ELL) software developed by KITE.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Driven**  : Designed by educators and technologists at [IT for Change](https://itforchange.net), ELA is driven by pedagogy, not technology.
- **Teacher First**    : ELA is teacher-facing software. There is no student <-> computer interaction.
- **Offline First**    : ELA is carefully architected to run on a desktop computer. No internet required.
- **Openness**         : ELA is licensed to be free and open source (FOSS). Always.
  

### What is 'ELA'
- 'ELA' is a polysemous acronym. That is, an acronym with multiple, related meanings.
- Language learning assessment is central to the software, and the English language in particular. ELA is therefore 'English Language Assessment'.
- In the immediate roadmap is support for other languages (Indian languages, to begin with). Here, ELA is therefore also 'E Language Assessment', the 'E' stands for 'Electronic' of course. 
- A future iteration of the software will also support other forms of assessments based on non-speech inputs such as MCQs that the teacher will record based on learner responses, and OCR scans of student paper MCQ responses etc. This could be in any subject of learning. Here, ELA is 'E Learning Assessment'. Note the absence of a hyphen between 'E' and 'Learning'. This is not 'E-Learning'. Learning happens in the classroom.
- Lastly, in homage to the Free Software Movement and The GNU Project, ELA of course is also a recursive acronym that expands to **ELA Learning Assessment**
  

### Software features
- Assessment of English language learner's speech, with focus on early speakers. 
- Support for _monologic_ and _dialogic_ oral productions (the dialog is between the learner and the teacher)
- A 9-point scale based reporting that is sensitive to early speakers' abilities in their home language(s)
- Recommendations of audio stories for learners to listen to, to improve listening skills, vocabulary and overall proficiency in the language (Work in progress)
